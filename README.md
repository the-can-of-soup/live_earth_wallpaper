# Live Earth Wallpaper

Updates your wallpaper with the most recent [Earth pictures from space](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/GOES/index.php) from the NOAA. Picture changes about every 10 minutes.

## Software Requirements

* Windows
* Python 3
* `requests` module (install with `py -m pip install requests`)
* `PIL` module (install with `py -m pip install pillow`)
* `pyautogui` module (install with `py -m pip install pyautogui`)

## Installation

1. Create an empty directory
2. Download `main.py` from this repository and put it in the directory
3. Open `main.py` and keep the terminal window running in the background to constantly update your wallpaper
4. Make sure to open `main.py` again every time you restart your computer if you want the wallpaper to stay up-to-date

If you close the terminal window, the wallpaper will stop changing and will stay on the last image.
